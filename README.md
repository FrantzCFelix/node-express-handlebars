A burger logger made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM! Also following the MVC design pattern!

## Description

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will change it's positionand be eaten! Every burger will store in a database, whether devoured or not.
